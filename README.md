Hi.

This code was an experiment/class project of mine to see how well AI, specifically ChatGPT, can create a simple news website on its own. 

HOW TO VIEW THE WEBSITE LOCALLY:

1: Open the green '<> Code' dropdown and clip the 'Download Zip' option
2: Find the downloaded zip in the file explorer
3: Right click on it and hit 'Extract All...'
4: Open the 'index' html file in the extracted folder
