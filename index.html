        <h2>Welcome to our News Website!</h2>
        <p>This innovative news website was crafted with the assistance of cutting-edge AI technologies. The content, structure, and design were shaped using ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. ChatGPT facilitated the generation of HTML code and the conceptualization of the website's layout. Additionally, the dynamic and responsive features, including the mouse-driven background image animation in the header, were implemented with the help of GPT-3.5, leveraging its powerful natural language processing capabilities. The collaboration between human creativity and artificial intelligence has resulted in a seamlessly integrated and visually appealing platform for delivering the latest news across various categories.

        <p>For generating images, we utilized the AI Text to Image Generator available at <a href="https://perchance.org/ai-text-to-image-generator" target="_blank">https://perchance.org/ai-text-to-image-generator</a>.
